# 3 Column Card Component

This project is a responsive 3-column card component built using HTML and CSS. It showcases three different vehicle types along with their descriptions and "Learn More" buttons. Below, we'll provide an overview of the project structure and the CSS styles used.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: This HTML file defines the structure of the 3-column card component. It contains the main content, including three vehicle sections, each consisting of an icon, a title, a description, and a "Learn More" button. It also links to external CSS and sets up the page's title and metadata.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file is responsible for styling the card component. It includes CSS reset styles and custom styling for the page. It handles layout, colors, typography, and button hover effects.

2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS file showcases various CSS styling techniques, such as box-sizing, margin and padding adjustments, and background colors.

3. **Responsive Design**: The project is designed to be responsive. It uses CSS Grid to adjust the layout and spacing of the card component for different screen sizes.

4. **Typography**: Custom fonts from Google Fonts are integrated into the project, enhancing the typography. Different font families and sizes are used to style the content.

5. **Color Schemes**: The project employs various background colors to create visually appealing cards, and button colors change on hover.

8. **External Font Integration**: The project imports fonts from Google Fonts using the `@import` rule in the HTML document's `<head>` section.

9. **Flexbox and Grid Layout**: The project uses CSS Grid to create a three-column layout for the card component, and Flexbox is used for vertically centering the content within each card.

10. **Hover Effects**: Hover effects are applied to the "Learn More" buttons to provide visual feedback to users.

11. **Box Model**: Box-sizing and margin adjustments are used to control the spacing and layout of elements.
